# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is designed to detect fake news using **Logistic Regression** and **TF-IDF Vectorization**. It processes textual data, converts it into numerical form, and classifies news articles as **Real or Fake**.

## Process
- Cleans and preprocesses text by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and applying stemming.
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** to transform text into a numerical format.
- Splits data into training and testing sets.
- Trains a **Logistic Regression model** to classify news articles.
- Evaluates model performance and makes predictions.

## Usage
- Loading  the dataset and preprocess the text.
- Training the model using a labeled dataset.
- Using the trained model to classify new articles as real or fake.

## Example Output
```sh
Prediction: Fake News
```

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled real and fake news articles, sourced from Kaggle.
